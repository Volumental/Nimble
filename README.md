# Nimble #

*Nimble* is a thin .net wrapper over OpenNI allowing .net applications to access OpenNI devices smoothly.

## Building ##
To build the test app OpenNI2 need to be installed and the `OPENNI2_REDIST` environment must be set. These are normally set automagically by the installer.

Only Visual Studio 2012 or later is needed to build the *Nimble* wrapper itself.

### Note ###
There are no Volumental specific code in this repository, but rather it only mimics the OpenNI2 API very closely. Thus it's suitable for Open Source.
